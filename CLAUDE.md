# Claude

AI assistant I use to generate TIL pages. Made by Anthropic.

## What I use it for

- writing these TIL documents
- explaining technical concepts in simple terms
- creating code examples
- research when I need current info (it can search web)

## How I get better results

- "write like a human, not wikipedia" - keeps it casual
- give it examples of the tone I want
- tell it to be concise
- ask it to think step-by-step for complex topics

## Useful for TILs

- good at taking technical topics and making them readable
- can create actual markdown files
- explains things without over-explaining
- fills knowledge gaps by searching when needed

## Limitations

- can be verbose if you don't ask for brevity

## Tips

- use existing TIL cross links as examples when needed
- be specific about format/length
- correct it when it's off - it adjusts
