## What is it

As software becomes commoditized, what separates good products from great ones isn't pure functionality anymore. It's something harder to pin down.

Some call it **taste**, others call it **product judgment**. Same thing, different words. It's the ability to make the right calls about what to build, how it should feel, and why it matters.

## How you develop it

It's not something you're born with. You build it through:

- Direct experience in your domain
- Deep understanding of your users
- Repeated exposure to what works and what doesn't

It's the skill that lets you create products that don't just solve problems but feel right. Products with cultural and emotional resonance.
